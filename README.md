# Fifa Tournament Manager

This small application aims to manage your local Fifa tournaments with your friends, so you don't need to use the in-game tournament creator.

It offers a match plan which is made for 5 players where each of them plays against everyone twice. The idea is that two matches can take place at the same time while one player takes a break. Goals, points etc. are displayed in the sorted results table. You can also freely switch teams during the tournament.

## How to start

Run `npm start` to start the application, it then runs locally in your browser (http://localhost:4200/).
